# bind '"\C-H":backward-kill-word' # It is such a common binding that almost every program supports it but the
# emulator has issues with this. This backspace a complete word with ctrl+backspace.
bind '"\C-H":"\C-w"' # This is a better alternative to above binding. It deletes a complete word till space.
